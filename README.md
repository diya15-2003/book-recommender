This is a semantic book recommender.
The project is made in guidance with video from freecodecamp.
the video link is provided below:
https://youtu.be/Q7mS1VHm3Yw?si=WpK8SQ8efSMsC4dz

the video uses multiple technologies python, langchain, openai and gradio.
Instead of using openAI, i used Hugging face model.
Some changes are still required in the dashboard.
